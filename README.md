## Useful Python Libraries

* **Pandas** - pandas is a fast, powerful, flexible and easy to use open source data analysis and manipulation tool,
built on top of the Python programming language. - https://pandas.pydata.org/

* **GeoPandas** - GeoPandas is an open source project to make working with geospatial data in python easier. GeoPandas extends the datatypes used by pandas to allow spatial operations on geometric types. Geometric operations are performed by shapely. Geopandas further depends on fiona for file access and descartes and matplotlib for plotting. - https://geopandas.org/

* **Shapely** - Shapely is a BSD-licensed Python package for manipulation and analysis of planar geometric objects. It is based on the widely deployed GEOS (the engine of PostGIS) and JTS (from which GEOS is ported) libraries. Shapely is not concerned with data formats or coordinate systems, but can be readily integrated with packages that are. -  https://shapely.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html

* **Moving Pandas** - MovingPandas implements Trajectory data structures and corresponding methods for handling movement data based on GeoPandas. - https://anitagraser.github.io/movingpandas/

* **Contextly** - contextily is a small Python 3 package to retrieve and write to disk tile maps from the internet into geospatial raster files. Bounding boxes can be passed in both WGS84 (EPSG:4326) and Spheric Mercator (EPSG:3857). - https://github.com/darribas/contextily

* **Cartopy** - Cartopy is a Python package designed for geospatial data processing in order to produce maps and other geospatial data analyses. Cartopy makes use of the powerful PROJ.4, NumPy and Shapely libraries and includes a programmatic interface built on top of Matplotlib for the creation of publication quality maps. Key features of cartopy are its object oriented projection definitions, and its ability to transform points, lines, vectors, polygons and images between those projections. - https://scitools.org.uk/cartopy/docs/latest/

* **Folium** - folium builds on the data wrangling strengths of the Python ecosystem and the mapping strengths of the leaflet.js library. Manipulate your data in Python, then visualize it in on a Leaflet map via folium. - https://python-visualization.github.io/folium/

* **IPyleaflet** - Interactive maps in the Jupyter notebook - https://ipyleaflet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html

* **Jupyter Book** - This is a guide and template for hosting your own book using Jupyter Notebooks and Jekyll.- https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter-book
